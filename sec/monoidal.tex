\subsection{Symmetric monoidal categories} 
One can use the same ideas to prove MacLane's coherence theorem for \emph{symmetric} monoidal categories, using the family of permutoassociahedra \cite{kapranov1993,reinerCoxeterassociahedra1994,baralicSimplePermutoassociahedron2019,CastilloLiu21}. 
Here we simply formulate the theorem, the proof is really the same as the one of \cref{thm:coherence-operahedra}.

Let $W_n$ denote the set of non-commutative, fully parenthesized words on $n$ distinct letters. 
Let $(\mathcal{C}, \otimes)$ be a symmetric monoidal category.
Each $w \in W_n$ defines in an obvious way a functor $[w] : \mathcal{C}^{\times n} \to \mathcal{C}$.
For instance, if $w=((ab)c)(ed)$, then the associated functor is defined on objects and morphisms by the formula
\begin{eqnarray*}
    [w] \quad : \quad \mathcal{C}^{\times n} & \to & \mathcal{C} \\
    (a,b,c,d,e) & \mapsto & ((a \otimes b) \otimes c)\otimes (e \otimes d) \ .
\end{eqnarray*}
We consider the free category $\mathcal{W}_n$ which has objects the elements of $W_n$, and morphisms generated by the ones of the form $\phi : w_1 \to w_2$, where the word $w_2$ is obtained from $w_1$ by applying either $\alpha : ((ww')w'') \to (w(w'w''))$, $\alpha^{-1}$, or $\tau : ww' \to w'w$ to a subword of $w_1$.
To any such $\phi$ one can associate a natural transformation $[\phi] : [w_1] \to [w_2]$ in $\mathcal{C}$ in the obvious way. 

\begin{thm}[MacLane's coherence theorem]
    \label{thm:MacLanesym}
    For any symmetric monoidal category $\mathcal{C}$, and for any pair of parallel morphisms $\phi_1,\phi_2: w_1 \to w_2$ in $\mathcal{W}=\{\mathcal{W}_n\}_{n\geq 1}$, we have $[\phi_1]=[\phi_2]$.
\end{thm}
