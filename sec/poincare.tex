\section{Poincar\'e duality} 
\label{s:poincare}


The Poincar\'e isomorphism between chains and cochains is precisely here the isomorphism establishing Koszul self-duality. This is particularly apparent from the last isomorphism $\Omega B \calO \cong C_{\bullet}^{\mathrm{cell}}(P_\mathrm{sub})$.

The intersection pairing gives the equivalence between the resolution and the operad.
