\section{Polytopal coherence theorem} 
\label{s:polycoherence}

Let $s=s_1 s_2 s_3$ be a path on the $1$-skeleton of $P$, that is a connected sequence of distinct edges, between two vertices $u$ and $v$.
Suppose that $s_2$ lies on a $2$-face $F$ of $P$, and let $s_2'$ be the complementary path on $F$ of $s_2$. 
Then, we say that $s$ is \emph{homotopic} to $s_1 s_2' s_3$.

\begin{thm}
    Let $s,t$ be any two parallel paths on the $1$-skeleton of $P$. 
    Then, $s$ and $t$ are homotopic. 
\end{thm}
