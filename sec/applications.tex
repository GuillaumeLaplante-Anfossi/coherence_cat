\subsection{Higher categories} 
\label{sec:higher}
\cref{thm:top-coherence} demonstrates that, in the case of monoidal categories, coherence is equivalent to the vanishing of the first homotopy groups of the associahedra. 
Since the associahedra are contractible, and therefore all their homotopy groups vanish, one could hope for a topological proof of higher dimensional coherence theorems.
Seeing a monoidal category as a bicategory with one object, one can ask about a coherence theorem for tricategories with one object. 
A first look at the diagrams in the beginning of \cite[Section 2]{gordonCoherenceTricategories1995} suggests that such a theorem should be at least related to the vanishing of the second homotopy groups of the associahedra.  
To formulate higher dimensional statements, one needs a good structure of pasting scheme on each associahedron, which is the subject of ongoing work \cite{AMMLA}. 

Recent results of S. Barkan provide evidence for these higher dimensional statements, in the context of $\infty$-operads \cite{barkanArityApproximationInfty2022}.
In this vein, it seems likely that the present results could be interpreted as a strict version and a special case of \cite[Theorem B]{barkanArityApproximationInfty2022}. 
It would be interesting to see how the permutoassociahedra arise in the strictification process, and how they are related to operadic partition complexes.
