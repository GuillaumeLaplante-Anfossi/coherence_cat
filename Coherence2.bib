Masuda, A. Tonks, H. Thomas and B. Vallette. We apply this theory to the study of the operahedra, a family of polytopes ranging from the associahedra to the permutahedra, and which encodes homotopy operads. After defining Loday realizations of the operahedra, we make a coherent choice of cellular approximations of the diagonal, which leads to a compatible topological cellular operad structure on them. This gives a model for topological and algebraic homotopy operads and an explicit functorial formula for their tensor product.},

These polytopes, known as hypergraph polytopes or nestohedra, fit in the interval from simplices to permutohedra (in any finite dimension). This interval was further stretched by Petri\'c to allow truncations of faces that are themselves obtained by truncations. Our notation applies to all these polytopes. As an illustration, we detail the case of Petri\'c's permutohedron-based associahedra. As an application, we present a criterion for determining whether edges of polytopes associated with the coherences of categorified operads correspond to sequential, or to parallel associativity.},
